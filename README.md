miiyoo-firmware-utils is a set of utilities for loading, querying,
modifying firmware for sex toys manufactured by Kiiroo. Generally
these toys share the same bootloader, and most of the logic for
loading firmware to them is the same. These utilities allow those
developing their own firmware to load it easily, or may allow users
with bricked toys to reload without having to return their hardware.
